# FreeThirst: React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is my own version of Instagram, serving as a clone. It's a React application leveraging React Query with Appwrite as its relational backend/BaaS. The app facilitates user functionalities such as Sign Up/Sign In, Profile Creation/Editing, Post Creation/Editing, Explore/Search for other posts, and Liking/Saving Posts. All of these features are wrapped within an elegantly designed and modern UI crafted using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
